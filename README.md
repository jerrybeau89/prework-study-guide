# Prework-Study Guide Webpage

## Description

- For this project, I am a student and beginner programmer learning various coding skills to become a full-stack developer or software engineer. 
- I built this project to develop my coding skills. I also wanted to develop a study guide that I can look back at to refresh my memory of what I learned. As well as, a living document that can be modify when new skills are learned and added to the study guide. 
- The project allows for new coders to review language on a website to study, but also allows for beginner coders to inspect the HTML through google developer tools to see how each element and piece of code affects the website. This code will also allow for the coder to use the console to see how the added JavaScript complies on the backend of the website.
- During this project I learned how to structure my HTML while building the UX and how the CSS affects the UX by modifying many different aspects of the code. Such as image size, text color, background color, alignment of the website and much more. CSS does this through a systematic process providing priorities to various elements over others depending on type or position or page. I also learned about using git in the terminal and basic JavaScript.

## Usage

To use this Prework Study Guide, you will be able to review the notes in each section on the webpage. To determine what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing by right clicking anywhere on the page and selecting inspect on the pop-up menu. A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics we learned from the prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first. You can also use the DevTools to add and test different features of HTML, Java, and CSS to the website without changing the actual code.
